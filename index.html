          <li>The html opening tag represents the root, or start of the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage. It is a container for metadata. It is not visible.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewpoint.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage using CSS:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Inline CSS</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Used to style an element directly in the HTML file.
                  <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag and styles a particular page element only.</li>
                  </li>
                  <li>Useful for quick and permanent changes but less flexible because each inline style must be edited individually whenever a design change is made.</li>
                </ul>
              <li>Internal CSS style sheet</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
                  <li>The rules only apply to that page, and can be used to style multiple elements in the page code.A single change to the CSS rule applies to all tagged page elements.</li>                  
                </ul>
              <li>External CSS style sheet</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Most common way to style a webpage. It's preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
                  <li>When using external style sheet, the file is linked using a link element placed in the HTML's head element.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
          <li>Diagram of a CSS Rule:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Selector: defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declaratioins, will apply.</li>
              <li>Declarations: contain the CSS property to apply and the value of that property.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>For example: in the declaration color:blue; the CSS property is color and the value is blue.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
          <li>Using CSS</li>
            <ul>
              <li>*selector: applies a rule to all elements visible on the page, such as margin and padding.</li>
              <li>Link the CSS file to the HTML document by adding the code to the header before the title.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>link element: creates the connection to the external file.</li>
                  <li>rel attribute: specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
                  <li>href attribute: specifies the URL of the external resource using a relative path.</li>
                </ul>
              <li>Class attribute selector: Used to add styles to certain elements, but not all elements. Class attributes allow the sharing of a CSS rule to any element chosen by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
              <li>.card: the period before card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these properties.</li>
              <li>margin: if top/bottom are same and widths are the same, then first entry is for top and bottom and second entry is for left/right.</li>
              <li>Margins and padding: A margin indicates how much space is around the outside of an element. A padding indicates how much space we want around the conent inside an element.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Basic JavaScript features</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Variables: containers that store values. Start by declaring a variable with var container-name, followed by the equal sign, then the "name you give to the variable", followed by a semicolon which is used to separate statements on a single line.</li>
              <li>Console log: the console.log method is used to output a message to the web console by adding an argument inside parenthesis.</li>
              <li>Link .js files under the footer and above the closing element for body.</li>
              <li>Use Chrome DevTools to view console.log output: right-click on the webpage and select Inspect. Select the console tab to view the output.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Control Flow</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
              <li>In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
              <li>Control flow can be interrupted using conditional statements and loops to the control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Conditional logic</li>
            <ul>
              <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into the code. When using the if statement, code will only execute IF the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
              <li>Using else if allows for more conditions.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Arrays</li>
            <ul>
              <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays arwe typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
              <li>To create an array, declare the variable using var, give the variable a name, and assign the variable a group of values inside brackets where each is inside quotes and there's a comma separating the values, ending with a semicolon. However, if different types of data is stored in an array, only use quotes around strings.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Using a for loop</li>
            <ul>
              <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. Developers must use another statement to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
              <li>Using a for loop tells the computer to go through each value in the array and log them to the console until there are no values left.</li>
              <li>A for loop contains the following 3 important statements:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>The first statement determines the starting point for the loop.</li>
                  <li>The second statement is the condition.</li>
                  <li>The third statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item.</li>
                </ul>
